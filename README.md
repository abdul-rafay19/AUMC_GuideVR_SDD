## 📌 About the Project

**AUMC GuideVR** is a virtual reality-based navigation solution designed for **Air University Multan Campus (AUMC)**.

This repository presents the **Software Design Document (SDD)**, crafted as a real-world design simulation under our **Software Design & Architecture** course.

Rather than coding first, we focused on *how* the system should be built — architecturally, structurally, and methodologically.

## 🔍 What’s Inside the SDD?

### 📐 Architecture

- Three-Tier Architecture (Presentation, Logic, Data)
- Modular, Scalable, Maintainable Design
- Web-based VR with A-Frame, WebXR, and Three.js

### 🧠 Design Methodologies

- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** for reusability & modularity
- **Agile with Scrum** for flexibility and iterative development
- Detailed comparison with Waterfall, V-Model, Spiral & RAD

### 🧩 Core Modules

## 🔧 Tools & Tech (For Future Implementation)

| Purpose             | Technologies |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Frontend VR         | A-Frame, WebXR, Three.js, HTML/CSS/JS |
| Backend Logic       | Node.js, Express |
| Database Layer      | MongoDB / Firebase |
| Design & Modeling   | UML, Lucidchart, Draw.io |

> 📌 Note: This repository only covers the **design**, not the implementation.

## 🌟 Why This Document Matters

> “Good code can’t fix bad architecture — but great design can prevent disaster.”

This Software Design Document lays the foundation for a real, scalable, and immersive VR system. It simulates a true industry-level design process — preparing us to think beyond code and see the bigger picture of software systems.
